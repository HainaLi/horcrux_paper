\section{Conclusion}

Passwords remain essential for web security, and improving the security of password management is an important goal for our community. We have demonstrated that it is possible for a password manager to minimize exposure of passwords to a few hundred lines of simple code, while using secret-sharing to mitigate the threat of server compromises. 

%and distribute trust, and shown that such an approach is compatible with 98\% of current websites.  

%\SecPass\ presents paranoid users the means to securely deliver, manage and distribute their passwords to trusted keystores using our prototype Firefox Add-On. We hope to see the overall trust in and data transparency of password managers improve given the ideas presented in this paper. \hnote{edited}
